Network Configuration Protocol:

Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is a network device configuration management protocol that provides mechanisms to install, 
manipulate, and delete configurations on network devices. It also provides a mechanism for notification subscriptions and 
asynchronous message delivery.



NETCONF consists of four layers:

Content layer: Contains the actual configuration and notification data.

Operations layer: Defines a set of base protocol operations to retrieve and edit the configuration data. Basic operations are <get-config>, <edit-config>, <lock>, <create-subscription>, <kill-session>, and similar.

Message layer: Provides a mechanism for encoding remote procedure calls. They are encoded in RPC invocations (<rpc> message), replies (<rpc-reply>), and notifications (<notification>).

Secure transport layer: Ensures a secure and reliable transport between a client and a server.
